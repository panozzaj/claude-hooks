# Instructions for Claude

See README.md for full documentation on the hook scripts, usage, and Claude Code hook system.

## Design Principles

### Informative Feedback to LLM

When auto-fixes are applied, scripts should provide detailed feedback about what was changed so the LLM can learn from corrections.

**Gold standard: RuboCop**
- Shows specific errors with line numbers
- Indicates which offenses were `[Corrected]`
- Automatically fixes what it can
- Shows errors for unfixable issues

All scripts should strive to:
1. Show what was wrong (specific errors/warnings with line numbers)
2. Indicate what was auto-fixed
3. Report unfixable issues with clear error messages
4. Provide enough context for the LLM to learn from the corrections

```

## Testing

To run tests, use the script and `tee` to avoid hanging:

```bash
./tests/run-tests 2>&1 | tee ./tmp/test-output.txt
```
